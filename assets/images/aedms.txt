Aggregated Barafiri Data Management System

This is an integrated system conceptually designed to ensure efficient digitization of personal education data of individuals, provide data management and reporting tools to relevant stakeholders.

This system will be developed using the a feasible iteration model.

Critical MVP for this design include:
	1. Landing Page
	2. User Management
	3. User Dashboards
